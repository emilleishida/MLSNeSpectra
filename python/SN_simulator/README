               sn_simulator.py has some code to simulate derivatives of spectra of SNe.
               At the beginning just:

               import sn_simulator
               
               
               sn_simulator.simulated_der( ... ) returns the derivative for a given set of PCs coefficients and epoch.
               sn_simulator.random_generator() returns a "synthetic" SN picked at random from a distribution similar to the original.

              run.py  applies user choices to the sn simulator and generate the corresponding simulated data in ../../data/
              there are 3 original extreme objects which are chosen as a starting point:
              max projection in PC1, min projection in PC1 and minimum projection in PC2

              user choices must be inputed in the begining of the file. To run from the command line do:
              python run.py
