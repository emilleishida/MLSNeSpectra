               sn_simulator.py has some code to simulate derivatives of spectra of SNe.
               At the beginning just:

               import sn_simulator
               
               
               sn_simulator.simulated_der( ... ) returns the derivative for a given set of PCs coefficients and epoch.
               sn_simulator.random_generator() returns a "synthetic" SN picked at random from a distribution similar to the original.
